# Euler-ODE

This code calculates solutions to simple first order differential equations through Euler's method, a numerical method of solving ODEs. This is not the most accurate, but it does generaly give a good approximation in most cases. Users can only input first order differential equations that are composed of polynomials. I have not implemented trig functions or other more complex functions into the calculator. Both homogenous and non-homogenous ODEs can be inputted, however. Input the ODE, the initial conditions, the desired point of solution x, and the step size. The smaller the step size, the more likely the answer is accurate. The code also contains a parser that takes in polynomial equations to be used. The equation may be of any length, as long as it is relatively simple.
